## Project Follow Me - plane_segmentation
Working threshold and angle values for .ply tests: (to improve)
 - from our realsense: 50 & 20
 - from chessboard (2200.ply) 0.1 & 20

NOTE: chessboard has a shit reference frame, help the algorithm telling that the normal is in between axis y and z (change normal to (0,1,1)).
